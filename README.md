# chatUp
## Introduction
This is a git repo of my Network and Communication assignment which I will try to convert into a GUI learning project using JavaFX. chatUp is an implementation of socket programming along with integration of multithreading. It's a simple chat application that runs on a local server allows connection of multiple clients and allows them to chat together either in chat rooms or in individual personal chats. 
## Initial Plan 
1. I first plan to make a backend java package that implements the normal client server model and is able to send and receive messages.
2. It is made possible to send messages amongst the clients, hence implementing the chat feature for both individual and group chats. **Using Multithreading**
3. Now, I plan on adding the feature for allowing a client to connect to multiple chatrooms.
4. I plan to make a frontend using JavaFX.
5. Integrate both the backend and frontend.
## Note
- This is my learning project. If you want to contribute to the project and have new ideas, feel free.
- I don'y know but may be I would try to implement it in MERN(*web*) as well as Flutter(*app*).
